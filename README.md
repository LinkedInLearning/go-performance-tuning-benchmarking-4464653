If you’re an intermediate Go developer, you probably already know that benchmarking is crucial for ascertaining and maintaining the performance of your program. In this course, join instructor Ayan George to take your skills to the next level and become a performance tuning and benchmarking MVP. Explore the basics of using the Go test tool and navigating the structure of a benchmark as well as how to manage the benchmark timer, clean up with b.Cleanup(), and use table-driven and parallel benchmarks. Along the way, Ayan covers some of the pitfalls of benchmarking that can compromise overall accuracy.

This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace.
